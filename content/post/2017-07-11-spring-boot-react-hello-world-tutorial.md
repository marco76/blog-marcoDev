I started to prepare a basic example of integration between React and Spring Boot.

You can find the code here : [https://github.com/marco76/spring-react-hello](https://github.com/marco76/spring-react-hello).

As you can read in the short documentation there is still some work to do.
When finished the example will be deployed with only one instruction and it will include some examples of routing and components.
The example will run online

If some feature are interesting for you (e.g authentication, file transfer) leave a comment or open a an issue on GitHub with your request.
